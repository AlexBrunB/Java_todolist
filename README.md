# Android Application Task Manager

The goal of this project is to have us discover the Android development environment in Java.

# TASKMANAGEMENT
The application that we have to create is a To Do List application.

The project’s basic functionalities are mandatory and set out as follows:
- The display task saved in the application
- The add, consult, editing and deletion tasks
- The status of the creation of a task (to do, done, etc.)
- The persistence of tasks added from one application launch to another.

A task is defined, at the very least, by:
- a title
- a content
- a due date/time
